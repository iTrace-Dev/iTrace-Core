# iTrace-Core

iTrace Core is a component of the iTrace platform. The core is responsible for managing all aspects of the physical eye tracking devices. It also maintains the session state and maintains any gaze related data files produced during the study. Lastly, the core assists with plugin management indicating when to start and stop recording information in the IDE.

# iTrace Core

iTrace Core gathers data from an eye tracker and sends screen coordinates to all connected plugins. Each plugin determines if the received coordinates are visible within its application and can record data about areas of interest that are being focused on.

### BASIC USAGE:
1) Start iTrace-Core
2) Setup a session
3) Select a tracker
4) Calibrate (if using a non-mouse tracker)
5) Connect one or more plugins
6) Start Tracking

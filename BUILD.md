### SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES
	* x64 (QT libraries are 64bit only for Visual Studio 2017)
	
### DEPENDENCY STRUCTURE NOTES
	* Tobii pro sdk dlls and lib files must be in the same directory
	
### REQUIREMENTS
* QT 5.11.1 and QT Creator
* Git
* Visual Studio 2017 (Visual C++ Compiler)
* Tobii Pro SDK v1.2.0.33 (newer versions not supported)
* CMAKE (only for cmake builds)

### WINDOWS BUILD
* Clone iTrace-Core repo
* Extract contents of [dependency zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kiDMIgbbvRWB2h_rz3nkJZsjFLu56SYg/view?usp=sharing) to a folder named "deps" in root of
	iTrace-Core repository
	
### BUILDING IN QT CREATOR
* Project paths should be configured correctly for Windows if the above steps are followed. If not, follow instructions below for QT Creator.
* NOTE: You might need to delete old build directories generated by Qt in order for auto generated files to be properly configured.

* Ensure project is type is set to: Desktop QT 5.11.1 MSVC2017 64bit

* Issues
	* When performing a fresh installation of the latest QT/QT Creator it is possible that iTrace core will be built, but QT Creator will refuse to run the application. A potential solution to this issue is to add the windows system32 directory to the user's environment variable path.

### Coding Standards
* Configure editor so indents are four spaces.
* Never use: `using namespace std;`.
	* Use the fully qualified namespace: `std::string foo;`.
* All filenames will be lower case.
	* If the name consists of multiple words, it will be concatenated with underscores: `my_file.txt`.
* C++ source filenames will end in `.cpp`.
* C++ header filenames will end in `.hpp`.
* Use the c++11 std library when possible and cross platform.
	* If no standard library functionality exists, then use Qt.
* Class and variable names will be camel case.
	* Classes will start with an uppercase.
	* variable names will start with lowercase.
* Constants will be in call caps.
* Do not use magic numbers. Instead, use named constants.

### Project Standards
* Do not commit autogenerated files to the project repository.
* Addition of any 3rd party libraries (other than support for trackers) must be requested in a GitHub issue complete with links to the library and explanation of its need/value for the project.
* If you are an internal member of the project and collaborating on features, please make your changes in a branch identified by issue number.
	* You may use forks if you are comfortable with that workflow and your feature requires minimal collaboration.
* When merging into develop or master, please issue a pull request for code review.
* Ensure that you periodically update branches with code changes from your branch base (master/develop/etc) to ensure that regressions and merge conflicts are resolved before pull requests are submitted.

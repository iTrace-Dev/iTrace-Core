### Coding Standards
* Configure editor so indents are four spaces (Should be the default in Visual Studio 2017).
* All source and WPF filenames will be Pascal Case (example: MainClass.cs).
* When possible If no standard library functionality exists, then use Qt.
* Naming Styles:
	* We are primarily following these (guidelines)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions] from Microsoft with the exception of local variables
	* Class names, members, and functions will be Pascal Case
	* Local variables and function parameters will be Camel Case (example: localVar).
		* Online examples from MS contradict the style guideline for local variables, but I feel this provides visual differentiation of scope for identifiers.
	* Constants will be in call caps.

* Do not use magic numbers. Instead, use named constants.

### Project Standards
* Do not commit autogenerated files to the project repository (with the exception of Visual Studio project files).
* Addition of any 3rd party libraries (other than support for trackers) must be requested in a GitHub issue complete with links to the library and explanation of its need/value for the project.
* If you are an internal member of the project and collaborating on features, please make your changes in a branch identified by issue number.
	* (If/When forking is enabled) You may use forks if you are comfortable with that workflow and your feature requires minimal collaboration.
* When merging into develop or master, please issue a pull request for code review.
* Ensure that you periodically update branches with code changes from your branch base (master/develop/etc) to ensure that regressions and merge conflicts are resolved before pull requests are submitted.
